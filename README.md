# Class-Automation-Bot ğŸ¤–

Don't want to attend class? This Python bot built using Selenium logs into your Google Meet for you then leaves after a certain time so you can sleep in and skip class.

***Note that I was just joking this was just a fun project, don't use this bot to skip class but it does log into your Google meet for you here's how to get started.*** 


> 1. Git clone the repository or download the project files 
> 2. Make sure to run **pip i selenium** and **pip i pyautogui**
> 3. Inside the **passwords.py** file change the variable names accordingly
> 4. Have fun testing it out!
